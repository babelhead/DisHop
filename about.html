    <h1>About me (in more sober terms)</h1>
    <p id=intro>I'm a <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/languages-and-cultures/about-us/people/erika-fulop">Lecturer in French Studies</a> at Lancaster University, specialized in 20th- and 21st-century literature, including (and now especially) (expreimental) electronic literature, and here I am in France learning some basic coding and co., crossing languages, cultures, and disciplines, at the moment mainly taking modules on the MA programmes of Paris 8 on electronic literature and digital humanities.<br>
        <br> 
        It's all very exciting and I have no idea what will come out of it, but I'm here to explore (also) how this learning opens my eyes to new modes of thinking and doing things. Welcome on board and enjoy the ride, if you do step over this line (and don't worry, you can get out at any point!)<br>
